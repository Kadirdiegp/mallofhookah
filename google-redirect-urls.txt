# Google OAuth Redirect URLs

Add ALL of these URLs to your Google Cloud Console OAuth Client configuration
under "Authorized redirect URIs":

# Supabase Callback URL (REQUIRED)
https://vsljkgqyszhqrbbptldq.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback

# Local Development URLs
http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback 

# Production URL (update with your actual domain)
# https://mallofhookah.com/auth/callback

After adding these URLs, click SAVE at the bottom of the Google OAuth consent screen.
Then wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate before testing again.
